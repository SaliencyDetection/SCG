# SCG
ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥The code for SCG: Saliency and Contour Guided Salient Instance SegmentationðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Usage
Coming soon

## Dataset
We adopt the training set of ILSO to train the Mask R-CNN part, and you can download the dataset in pickle format from . [DUTS](http://saliencydetection.net/duts/) and [PASCAL VOC Context]() are used to train the saliency and contour branch, respectively.





## Test
We provide the pretrained model for SCG* in [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BggBtg4GJFNioRy0n5f1vQ)(plsf).
